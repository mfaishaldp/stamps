Please create an array/list of numbers from 1 to 100. Print all these numbers in reverse order, but with the following rules :

Do not print prime numbers.
Replace numbers divisible by 3 with the text "Foo."
Replace numbers divisible by 5 with the text "Bar."
Replace numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with the text "FooBar."
Print the numbers horizontally, not vertically.
